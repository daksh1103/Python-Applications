A few Python Application that was done for Self  Learning and better understanding .
In this file I have created few python scripts to make my basics strong and to learn few very useful modules of python.
in the TIC TAC TOE ,i have created a game for two players then i realised there was GUI concept missing and so i started to learn GUI in python and then i developed this Calculator.py script that enhances the way application looks .
The in webpage.py script i have tried to develop webpages in python  .
The applicationrestart.py scripy helps to restart the current application with the corresponding file passed as input .This helps to commit changes when the application is currently running.
